So, we want to find data that can create a model to predict cardiovascular diseases based on various other symptoms and biological info. \n",

    "First, we will upload our data to Github. The statistical analysis we will apply to answer our research question is the nonparametric statistical method, and logistic regression analysis, ROC, AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and so on. And we will use bar plots, boxplots, and histograms, and so on to finish Exploratory Data Analysis. Based on the result of EDA, we may apply the box cox function to finish normalization, if there are any missing values, we will apply the KNN method to fill them. After data preparation, we will base on our domain knowledge to finish feature selection. Then we will apply the binary logistic regression model, random forest model, and XGboost model to explanatory attributes that we selected and select the best model by using AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, etc. Then we will apply the stacking method to construct an ensemble model. Finally, we compare the ensemble model with the best model we selected before and answer our research questions with the result."
